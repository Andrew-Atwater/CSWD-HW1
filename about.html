                Glacier National Park was established in 1910 and is often referred to as the “Crown of the Continent” due to its dramatic alpine skyline and ecological significance. The park shares an international border with Canada’s Waterton Lakes National Park, forming the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park—the world’s first international peace park, designated in 1932. Long before its federal designation, the land was home to the Blackfeet, Salish, and Kootenai peoples, whose cultural traditions remain deeply connected to the landscape. The park’s history reflects both conservation efforts and the ongoing impact of climate change, particularly the retreat of its historic glaciers.
The terrain is defined by rugged peaks, deep glacial valleys, alpine meadows, and over 700 miles of hiking trails. Elevations range from forested lowlands to dramatic summits exceeding 10,000 feet. Wildlife is abundant and diverse, including grizzly and black bears, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, moose, elk, and gray wolves. The park is also home to hundreds of bird species and a wide range of native plant life. This unique convergence of ecosystems makes Glacier one of the most biologically intact environments in the lower 48 states.
