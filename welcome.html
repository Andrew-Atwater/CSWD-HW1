            <p>Glacier National Park, located in Northwestern Montana, is one of the most beautiful places in the Western U.S. to visit for people who love the outdoors. 
                    Nestled in the Rocky Mountains, the rugged Lewis and Livingston sub-ranges frame this haven of natural beauty. 
                    Boasting over 150 peaks over 8000 feet, as well as 26 active glaciers, Glacier National Park remains one of the few places in the contiguous U.S. where glaciers can be found.
