Andrew Atwater - CSWD HW1 reflection

The biggest challenges I faced during the development of this homework were definitely
figuring out the CSS formatting for everything to make it look relatively decent. I have
had experience with HTML in web scraping, so I had a decent idea as to how it worked, but
was entirely new to CSS. At first, I had made a new style for every element, but then I
realized I could use inheritance and make new styles for each "class" in a tag. I left
the early stage CSS the way it was to show the change. The image resizing was also tough,
and I always ended up with weirdly stretched or off-center images so I used ChatGPT to help
a little bit with that as well as the actual site content, but other than that I made it my
goal to do as little of the actual HTML and CSS with AI assistance as possible.
