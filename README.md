Topic: Travel Destination Website
Objective: Create a three-page website promoting a travel destination of your choice, utilizing
HTML5, CSS, and image resizing techniques. All content should be professionally oriented and
something you'd be happy to share with the dean of the school.

Resources Optional Resources:
Free Web Host: https://www.infinityfree.com/
HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
Validator HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu
Validator CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Instructions:
1. Choose a travel destination that you find interesting and create three HTML pages related to
that destination. A welcome or landing page (first page seen when arriving at the sight), about,
and informational page(s).
2. Use HTML5 and ensure that all HTML pages pass validation using online validator, see
resources above.
3. Link the pages to each other using anchor tags <a>, providing intuitive navigation for users to
explore different aspects of the destination. Each page should have links to the other pages.
4. Include an email link on each page to allow visitors to contact the website owner for inquiries
or feedback. Placing in the footer of the page is an option.
5. Create an external CSS file and link it to each HTML page using the <link> tag. Use CSS
selectors to apply styling and create an aesthetically pleasing look for your web pages. See
resources above.
6. Ensure that the CSS file passes validation using online validator, see resources above.
7. Select relevant images that represent the travel destination and resize them for optimal web
presentation while maintaining aspect ratio. Include these resized images appropriately within
your web pages. File sizes that are large slow down page loads. Using thumbnails on a page
should only have files optimized (pixels per inch PPI, file size, aspect ratios, etc.) as large as
needed, no more. A thumbnail is normally no more than 75K for example.
Images should have figure and fig caption tags applied correctly.
8. Include comments with citations of where you found information.
<!—comment is formatted like this in html -->
9. Create a text file with yourName_reflection.txt saved in the root folder. Include a brief
reflection on the challenges faced and lessons learned during the process.

Submission Guidelines:
- Upload your root folder to your server. Identify the correct URL for this assignment's directory
and submit in the comments of the assignment on Brightspace.
- Submit the three HTML pages, the CSS file, and the resized images in a .zip folder to
Brightspace.
Additional Tips:
- Provide informative content about the travel destination, including attractions, activities, and
local culture.
- Use CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the website, such as using color schemes that reflect
the destination's ambiance.
- Encourage students to use responsive design techniques to ensure the website is mobilefriendly.
